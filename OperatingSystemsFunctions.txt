Developed by Google, Android is one of the popular mobile operating systems. Though it has poor camera quality, it ultimately is a pretty fast system. That comes in handy with 
mobile devices. It often gets compared to IOS which is known to be more popular but Android is often liked becuase it is less expensive than its competitor. 

IOS, also known to be apart of all Apple devces, are super popular today. It is known for its amazing camera quality, water damage and screen shatter durability, as well as its
constant updates. However, these updates can be rather annoying; changing the setup and setting menu so often. One other downside is that IOS operating systems are typically very 
pricey 

Windows is another popular operating system. It is really useful becuase it connects wel with GUI, software, and hardware. It is very user friednly and without it, using computer 
tasks to perform tasks would be impossible. It also has multiple versions that you can swith from if needed.
